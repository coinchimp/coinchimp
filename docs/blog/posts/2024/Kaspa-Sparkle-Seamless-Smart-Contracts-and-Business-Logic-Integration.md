## Introducing Sparkle: Kaspa's Layer 1.5 for Seamless Smart Contracts and Business Logic Integration

In a prior discussion, an open video call on July 9th posted on Kaspa’s YouTube channel, Kaspa core developers, including Aspect, Shai Wyborski, and Yonatan Sompolinsky, considered two approaches for implementing smart contracts. One of the guests at this meeting was Ilia from StarkWare, an industry leader in ZK tech specializing in zero-knowledge rollups and ZK-VMs. Kaspa’s developers debated two paths forward: one option was to go fully native with Rust, aligning well with Kaspa’s speed and architecture, though it would take longer to build. The alternative was to integrate with established ZK ecosystems, like StarkWare's ZK-VM, to leverage pre-existing tools and smart contract compatibility.

Following this, a few days ago, Aspect presented a nearly 5-hour workshop at the Kaspa Innovation Summit in Hong Kong, introducing Sparkle as a solution for efficient ZK proof verification and zk-Rollups on Kaspa’s Layer 1. Sparkle integrates seamlessly with Kaspa’s BlockDAG, offering a flexible multi-state model, decentralized proofer incentives, and streamlined proofing scripts. Designed for low-resource use and requiring no hard fork, Sparkle enables scalable smart contracts on Kaspa.

In the latest Blockchain Banter, Aspect highlighted that Sparkle is a community-driven project being funded through KSPRbot. This support from KSPRbot enables Sparkle to be developed independently from Kaspa’s core development team, allowing it to explore new frameworks and integrate seamlessly with Kaspa’s technology while staying aligned with the community’s goals. Sparkle operates as a separate peer-to-peer network and is set for release next summer, with applications spanning various sectors, including gaming.


### What Is Sparkle?

Sparkle is a sort of Layer 1.5 solution that integrates with the Kaspa BlockDAG. I say sort of Layer 1.5 because Aspect mentioned they want to keep Kaspa Network Fundamentals untouchable, adding an extra service offering a bridge between the base network (Layer 1) and more advanced Layer 2 functionalities. This unique positioning allows Sparkle to support a variety of smart contract features and business logic without the complexity and overhead of other blockchain platforms. Importantly, Sparkle operates independently of Kaspa's core development team and is funded by the community through the KSPRbot initiative, with a functional service targeted for Summer next year.

### Key Goals of Sparkle: Empowering Businesses and Users Alike

Aspect emphasized that Sparkle’s design aims to serve a wide range of use cases, particularly in areas like gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi). The primary goals are:

1. **Layer 1 ZK Proof Verification**: Sparkle integrates ZK proof technology directly on Layer 1, allowing for zk-Rollups, which can bundle multiple transactions and validate them as a single proof.
2. **User-Friendly Integration for Business Logic**: By avoiding the complexities of existing smart contract frameworks, Sparkle makes it easy to implement custom logic. Businesses in industries like gaming can tailor their applications without being bound by traditional blockchain constraints.
3. **Flexibility and Minimal Resources**: Sparkle will work either as an extension to Kaspa’s core node or independently, allowing deployment on everyday devices without needing high computing power. This approach preserves Kaspa’s decentralized ethos.

### How Does ZK Proof Work in Simple Terms?

ZK proofs are based on math—lots of math! The idea is that a "prover" (someone who knows the secret information) creates a mathematical proof that a "verifier" (someone who doesn’t know the information) can check. The verifier can confirm the proof without learning the actual secret.

A popular example is like a locked door. Imagine there’s a room with a secret code on the other side. You say, "I know the code," but you don’t want to tell me what it is. Instead, you go inside, unlock the door, and come out through another exit. I know you unlocked it, so I believe you, but I never learned the actual code.

### How Sparkle’s Smart Contract Design Stands Out

Unlike traditional smart contracts, which can be heavy on resources and often require extensive development modifications, Sparkle is designed to fit seamlessly with Kaspa’s existing infrastructure. Here’s how:

- **ZK Rollups for Efficiency**: As I said before, ZK Rollups are Sparkle’s backbone for handling transactions efficiently. By allowing multiple transactions to be bundled into a single proof and verified on Kaspa’s Layer 1, ZK Rollups drastically reduce the computational load, enabling faster and more cost-effective transactions.

- **No Disruptive Design**: Sparkle functions as a middle ground, not quite Layer 2 but more advanced than typical Highly eficient Proof of Work Network operations. This sort of "Layer 1.5" approach offers a hybrid solution that maintains security without compromising scalability.
- **No Hard Fork Required**: Sparkle operates independently of Kaspa’s core BlockDAG and doesn’t require a major update to the base network. However, the upcoming Crescendo hard fork will provide additional support for Sparkle contributing with some of the requirements not provided today, helping to streamline its functionalities.

### Core Components of Sparkle’s Smart Contract Infrastructure

1. **State Management and Multi-State Model**: Sparkle allows for a flexible multi-state model, where different aspects of a business application can run independently within the same environment. For instance, in a game, various in-game assets or states can be managed separately without needing to validate the entire state each time. This approach reduces verification time and helps optimize performance.
2. **Proofer Ecosystem and Incentives**: Sparkle introduces a multi-proofer system similar to Kaspa's PoW mining setup. Proofers are incentivized to verify transactions by including reward addresses, which promotes decentralized proof generation. This system is designed for first-come, first-served processing, promoting fair and distributed participation.
3. **Payload-Based Proofing Scripts**: Sparkle employs scripts that can support multiple state changes and include specific opcodes for ZK verification. This setup allows developers to structure proof requirements and interact with different states efficiently, ensuring a streamlined experience for Layer 1 and Layer 2 operations.

### Future-Proof and EVM-Free

One key feature of Sparkle is its independence from Ethereum’s EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) standards. This design decision is intentional, allowing Kaspa to avoid the limitations, performance issues and fees associated with EVM-based networks. Sparkle is considering zkVM support to allow for future Layer 2 compatibility, ensuring that Kaspa can evolve alongside advancements in zero-knowledge technology without being constrained by existing standards.

### What This Means for the Kaspa Community

Sparkle’s development is driven by the need to make advanced smart contract capabilities accessible to all. Its lightweight requirements mean it can run on standard devices without sacrificing decentralization or scalability. As a project funded by KSPRbot, Sparkle demonstrates the strength of community-driven innovation in the Kaspa ecosystem.

### Looking Ahead: Sparkle’s Impact on Kaspa

With Sparkle, Aspect aims to make Kaspa a viable platform for high-performance applications, particularly in areas where decentralized applications are expanding, like gaming and finance. By integrating ZK proofs and a multi-state model on Layer 1.5, Sparkle is set to transform how developers and businesses approach decentralized solutions on Kaspa.

In summary, Sparkle represents a significant leap forward for Kaspa by:
- Enabling seamless integration of custom business logic.
- Supporting efficient, fast and low-cost ZK verification on Kaspa as Layer 1.
- Maintaining the decentralized ethos of Kaspa through minimal resource requirements.
  
By Summer next year, Kaspa could be home to a truly accessible, efficient, and scalable smart contract platform, thanks to Sparkle. This project is a testament to what community-backed innovation can achieve, and it highlights the Kaspa network’s potential to redefine the landscape of decentralized applications.
