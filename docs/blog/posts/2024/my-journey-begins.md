# Diving Into a World of Coding and Crypto: My Journey Begins

Hello everyone, and welcome to the very first blog post on CoinChimp! I'm thrilled to kick off this adventure where I'll be sharing everything I learn along the way. Whether you're a seasoned coder or just dipping your toes into the crypto waters, I hope you'll find something useful here.

### Starting with Rust

My coding journey has taken a new turn—I've started exploring Rust! After dabbling in Python and Go, I noticed Rust's rising popularity, not just in the tech community but especially in the crypto space. It’s an exciting change, and I'm eager to dive deeper.

### Automating Discord Alerts

Recently, I launched my first application—a simple yet effective tool to automate alerts on Discord. Using a webhook service on Google Cloud Run, I managed to simplify what initially seemed a daunting task. This experience was not just about coding; it was about bringing my entire toolkit into play. From containers and Kubernetes to integrating ChatGPT for faster coding without sweating over syntax, every bit of my tech background helped streamline the process.

### Learning on the Fly

The journey wasn’t smooth from the start. I initially tried using Discord’s developer portal to register an app but soon realized managing tokens and redirect links was getting too complex. Switching to webhook integrations simplified everything, allowing me to quickly wrap up my first version. 

Another major leap was utilizing GitHub Actions, which seamlessly pushed my code changes to a live service on Google Cloud Run. It's impressive how much insight one can gain from GitHub's logs—they really make debugging a breeze.

### TradingView and Family Crypto Adventures

My project allowed me to send TradingView alerts directly to my personal server, simplifying how I track market movements. This not only cuts down the clutter of phone notifications but also lets me share insights with my wife, a brilliant mind in the crypto world. Together, we're navigating this fascinating era of financial innovation.

### The Bigger Picture

Exploring cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Kaspa, and Radiant has been enlightening. Their underlying technologies fascinate me—the decentralized networks, the complex algorithms, and the way they ensure transparency without a central authority. It’s a testament to how blockchain can safeguard not just financial transactions but potentially any valuable data across industries.

### Looking Ahead

While many coins may not withstand the upcoming bear market, the knowledge and technologies we develop will pave the way for future applications. This isn't just about investments—it's about understanding and possibly revolutionizing how we interact with digital information.

I'm excited about where this journey will take me, and I hope to turn this passion into a sustainable livelihood. Here's to the many learnings and shared experiences ahead!

Cheers to new beginnings!
